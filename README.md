# TechLegendsTrivia
Tech Legends Trivia is an Android application designed to test users' knowledge about famous personalities in the technology sector. The app presents a series of questions, each with four possible answers, and the user must select the correct one. This project is currently a work in progress and demonstrates my learning journey in Android development using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and various other modern Android development tools.

* **Refine Dependency Injection**: Identify and fix issues in the Hilt implementation.
* **Testing**: Conduct unit and UI tests for application reliability.
* **App Icon**: Design and add a distinct app icon.
* **Fix Known Issues**:
    * Image scaling in answer cards.
    * Correct level selection mechanism.
    * Resolve skip behavior (described above).
    * Fix non-functional reset/exit buttons on the alert dialog.
